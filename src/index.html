    	<p>Welcome to my Recipe book!</p>
    	<p>I love to cook and feed people. These are my recipes from years of experimentation and exploration. Many of the recipes were inspired by books, videos and cooking shows. I loved to watch Julia Childs, Martin Yan, Cajun Cooking and many other shows as a kid.</p>
